# Privacy Policy for Exply.dev Services

Last Updated: 2025-11-02

This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled by exply.dev services, including GPT agents and API services, when you interact with our platform.

## Information We Collect

When you use exply.dev services to create a project request or interact with our APIs, the following information may be collected:

- The **concept** of your project idea
- The **core MVP features** you define
- The **estimated cost and timeline** generated during the conversation
- Any additional information you voluntarily provide during the interaction

This information is used solely to create and manage project proposals in our public GitHub repositories.

## How We Use Your Information

The collected information is used exclusively for the following purposes:

- To create a public issue in the `exply-dev/exply-dev-public-projects` GitHub repository
- To manage and track project proposals
- To facilitate communication between project founders and potential team members

All actions are performed only with your explicit consent at the end of our conversation.

## Information Sharing

The GitHub issues created will be **publicly visible**, as they are posted in public repositories. Please do not share any sensitive or confidential information that you would not want to be made public.

All project proposals are stored in:
- **Repository:** [exply-dev/exply-dev-public-projects](https://github.com/exply-dev/exply-dev-public-projects)

## Data Security

We do not store your conversation data beyond what is necessary to create the GitHub issue. The information is passed directly to the GitHub API to create the issue and is not retained by our services beyond this purpose.

## Data Retention

- Conversation data with GPT agents is not stored
- Only the final project proposal (as a GitHub issue) is persisted
- You can delete or modify your project proposal at any time directly on GitHub

## Your Rights

You have the right to:
- Request deletion of your project proposal (by closing or deleting the GitHub issue)
- Modify your project proposal at any time
- View all data associated with your project proposal on the public GitHub repository

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
